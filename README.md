## What that ?
This is a software in nodejs that I developed in 1-2 days, really minimalist, it allows to dumper .swf compiled in .exe to be able to do something else ^^, to do this I modified a small program in C that already allowed to do it but you needed gcc or other etc, so I made a port of it and transformed it into .exe to be able to use it.

I found the original C program [here](http://www.nullsecurity.org/article/extracting_swf_from_flash_projector)

This program can only run on Windows (and maybe Linux via Wine)
